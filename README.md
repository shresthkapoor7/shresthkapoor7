## Hey there

I'm Shresth — CS grad student at NYU Tandon, currently navigating cursed bugs, half-built ideas, and the fantasy that I’ll ship before burnout kicks in. Before this, I was building enterprise stuff at [TalentTitan](https://talenttitan.com) (read: pushing to prod while on Zoom calls titled "quick sync"). Angular + Spring Boot + ✨ corporate chaos ✨. The [code](https://github.com/ShresthKapoor8) was neat; the meetings were not.

Did my undergrad at SRM IST, where I learned three things:  
1. How to stare at a terminal for hours  
2. How to pretend group projects were collaborative  
3. And that debugging at 3AM is basically a rite of passage

Now I’m in NYC DMing founders who leave me on read, and pretending to raise shareholder value (and maybe self-worth) along the way.

If corporate-flavored compliments and buttoned-up buzzwords are your thing, stalk away on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shresth-kapoor-7skp/)—I clean up nice there. And thanks to Premium, I’ll know you stopped by... right next to my ex in profile views. 👀

If none of this works out, I’ll probably end up streaming “day in the life” videos from a WeWork I can’t afford. Or making content on OnlyFans. Who knows.
