As an MS Computer Science student at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, I am passionate about building innovative projects that integrate the latest technologies. My current interests lie in leveraging the technologies I have learned, such as Flutter and Angular, and enhancing them with AI capabilities.

Previously, during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science Engineering at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, I honed my skills in software development and problem-solving. I am constantly exploring new domains and working on projects that merge cutting-edge AI, software engineering, and user-centric design.

If you are looking for collaboration or have job opportunities in areas like software development, AI, or cross-platform application development, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn! </p>
