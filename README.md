## Hey there
I'm Shresth, a CS grad student at NYU Tandon trying to survive with Flutter, Angular, and the occasional AI sprinkle.

Before this, I was building scalable apps at [TalentTitan](https://talenttitan.com) using Angular and Spring Boot. Some of my work lives [here](https://github.com/ShresthKapoor8) (private, because corporate 🙃).

Did my undergrad at SRM IST, where I built cool stuff, solved real problems, and stared at terminals way too long. Now it’s just classes, caffeine, and half-finished ideas.

If corporate-flavored compliments and buttoned-up buzzwords are your thing, stalk away on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shresth-kapoor-7skp/)—I clean up nice there. And thanks to Premium, I’ll know you stopped by... right next to my ex in profile views. 👀

If none of this works out, you’ll probably find me dropping content on OnlyFans next.
