As a final year Computer Science Engineering student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, I am passionate about software development and problem solving. I am currently practicing data structures and algorithms and working on cross-platform applications using Flutter. I have recently gained an interest in building projects related to the Internet of Things, natural language processing, and DevOps. If you have any job or collaboration opportunities in these areas, please don't hesitate to reach out to me on LinkedIn. </p>
